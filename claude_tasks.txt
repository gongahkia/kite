## CONCLUSION
## ==========

Kite has a strong foundation. These enhancements will transform it from
a capable scraping library into an essential tool for the legal industry.

The focus on legal domain expertise, data quality, and practitioner
workflows will drive adoption where it matters: law firms, legal tech
companies, academic researchers, and public interest organizations.

Success requires maintaining the clean architecture and production-ready
mindset while adding features lawyers actually need. The roadmap balances
immediate value (citation extraction, case briefs) with long-term vision
(knowledge graphs, predictive analytics).

Most importantly, this positions Kite as infrastructure for the legal
tech ecosystem - not just another tool, but a foundational building block
for the future of legal research and analysis.
