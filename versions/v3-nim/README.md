# Version 3 (Nim)

Version 3 is the Nim rewrite providing a static binary, fast startup, and parity with prior versions.

- Language: Nim (latest stable)
- Sources: currently under repository `src/` (will be the canonical v3 location)
- Binary: `kite`
- Metrics: Prometheus at /metrics; health at /health

This folder documents v3; sources are maintained at the repository root `src/` to avoid breaking imports and build paths.
